        <div>It was the famous photojournalist Robert Capa who once said “If your photographs aren’t good enough, you’re
            not close enough.” He was talking about getting in amongst the action. If you feel like your images aren’t
            ‘popping’, take a step or two closer to your subject. Fill the frame with your subject and see how much
            better your photo will look without so much wasted space. The closer you are to the subject, the better you
            can see their facial expressions too.
        </div>
        <div>You might think that you should only use flash at night time or indoors, but that’s not the case at all. If
            it is an extremely bright day outside and the sun is creating harsh shadows on your subject, switch on your
            flash. By forcing extra light onto your subject, you will be able to fill in those ugly shadows and create
            an even exposure.

        <div>A well timed joke will always yield a more natural smile, than simply saying “smile” — Dean Bottrell</div>
        <div>Having expensive camera equipment doesn’t always mean that you’ll take good photos. I’ve seen some
            absolutely amazing images shot with nothing more than a smart phone. Instead of having ten different lenses,
            invest in some fantastic photography books.
        </div>
        <div>Shade can be your best friend. If there is no way you can make the available light work for your photo,
            shoot in the shade. You’ll get a nice even exposure with no patchy highlights throughout your shot.
        </div>
        <div>This is one of the most common tips that pop up when it comes to improving your photos.

            To break it down, you cut your frame into thirds by using both horizontal and vertical lines. You then place
            your point of interest over the cross sections of the grid.
        </div>
        <div>I’ve been shooting a lot of protests lately. Basically, they’re just a lot of people really close to one
            another; often moving. After having made many mistakes with getting my exposures right, I worked out that if
            the sun is behind me and in the face of protestors I will set exposure compensation to underexpose by a stop
            to bring out even tonal range. When the sun is behind the protestors I like to over expose just slightly to
            bring out the shadow details on their faces. This could apply to street photography when the light is in
            front or behind your subject. — Justin Wilkes
        </div>
        <div>Variation is key. I often use a recipe from Life Magazine picture editors for building a story narrative. I
            look for: over-all shots or scene-setters, interaction, action, portraits, details, medium shots and of
            course the signature image.
